The project is based on a study by Peter E. Clayson, Harold Rocha, Julia B. McDonald, Scott Baldwin, and Michael J. Larson, available at [https://osf.io/qt2zh/](https://osf.io/qt2zh/).

# The Goal of the Project
The goal of the project is to determine whether brain signals following correct or erroneous responses are similar across different tasks. The dataset contains EEG recordings from three versions of the Flanker task. The simplest approach to validate this hypothesis is to train a classification model using data from two tasks and then validate the model using the third dataset. If successful, it indicates that brain responses are sufficiently similar across tasks for successful classification.

The []() Jupyter notebook contains code for downloading and creating Epochs for the project. The number of subjects' data to download is chosen manually. Keep in mind that the full dataset is 122.8GB.
