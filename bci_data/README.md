The data folder avaliable at: [https://bit.ly/3PGaNiG](https://bit.ly/3PGaNiG) contains EEG recordings from 10 participants sourced from the  [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/S001/#files-) Task 2, which involves imagining opening and closing the left or right fist. 
The raw data were filtered with a bandpass filter of 0.1 - 30 Hz. 
Only EEG channels were retained, and any bad channels were dropped. The epochs span from -1s to 4s.
